# SAG (Sulfuric Acid Generator)

This project is my DIY aproach to make continuous production of sulfuric acid.
SAG is a small, easy to use, and portable, device that can be used to generate sulfuric acid.
It can generate sulfuric acid as long as it is connected to a power source and is supplied with sulfur.
